# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
Iâ€™ve chosen this project because I feel most proud of how I worked through it as it was a difficult one for me to complete. I learned a lot about classes in C++ and how to use them to declutter my code. The application takes the initial investment amount, monthly deposit, annual interest, and the number of years as input from the user. It then outputs the total balance and interest with and without monthly deposits for each year formatted into two charts.

# What did you do particularly well?
I am proud of how I was able to transfer the math needed into code for this project. I am also proud of myself for learning how to correctly format header files and include classes into the main file.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I feel to improve my code, I could benefit from adding a try/catch block for my C++ user input validation. This would make my code more secure because exceptions would be caught by the "catch" blocks.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging part was working with user validation. I wanted to find a way to catch all possible exceptions, but I kept hitting a wall where my loop command would infinitely loop. Using separate while commands for each option that looped until the user entered a valid input fixed the issue.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Learning how to work with header files and classes will be extremely important for me while I continue my studies. Classes will help keep my code maintainable and ensure the main program only accesses the necessary functions. 

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I kept my project clean by commenting my code and making notes of what specific functions did. I made sure not to comment on every single line but only on the important sections.
